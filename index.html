        <h2>2th Year Project</h2>
        <p>For my project in 2nd year it was a group project, we created a bus tracking system that allows users to track buses in real time. This system provides essential information such as bus routes,
            bus numbers, and the last stop passed, helping users plan their day and arrive at their destination on time. The project aimed to address the growing need for efficient public transport systems
            , as buses not only reduce traffic and save fuel but also contribute to reducing global warming. Our team, consisting of Michael Olaogun, Christian Patrick, and Daniel Omozokpia, worked together
            to design and develop this system, understanding how valuable it could be for both commuters and the environment.
            </p>
        <h2>4th Year Project</h2>
        <p>Cloud-based Secure File Sharing System: The aim of my project is to address the growing need for secure and efficient remote collaboration. 
            By integrating TrueNAS, Nextcloud, and Seafile, the platform provides a comprehensive solution that prioritizes the core principles of information 
            security: confidentiality, integrity, access control, and availability. TrueNAS ensures robust and scalable backend storage, Nextcloud enables real-time collaboration and synchronization,
             and Seafile delivers high-performance file synchronization. Together, these technologies create a secure, flexible, and user-friendly system for remote access, advanced encryption, 
             and multi-layered user authentication, empowering organizations to protect sensitive data while enhancing productivity in a remote work environment.
